Practice with algorithms, static methods and procedural decomposition

Recall that a static method is a group of statements.  They usually create the structure in the program and eliminate redundancy.  
You will test your skills with procedural decomposition and Java-ify a popular song.  

### Below are the lyrics to Taylor Swift's popular song "Shake it off":  
How would make this more concise, than just printing all of the lyrics.  There is obivous repitition and structure to the song. 

### :pushpin: Your Requirements: 
1. Decompose "Shake it off" into static methods. The code should represent the song in a concise way. 
2. The names of the static methods should be appropriately named. 
3. When your program is run, the lyrics should print exactly like you see them below.  Formatting included.  
4. The static methods should consist of the following: 1) Call another static method 2) Have print statements 3) For loops to repeat methods or print statments

### :pencil2: Reflection and Write up 
Add comments to your code that answer the following questions: 
> 1. Summarize your approach to decomposing the song into static methods. (How did you know where to start, what things did you look for?)
> 2. At what point is it no longer beneficial to keep splitting up the lyrics into new static methods? When does it no longer become a more concise representation of the song?

I stay out too late, got nothin' in my brain  
That's what people say, mmm hmm, that's what people say, mmm hmm  
I go on too many dates, but I can't make 'em stay  
At least that's what people say mmm mmm, that's what people say mmm mmm  

But I keep cruising, can't stop, won't stop moving  
It's like I got this music in my mind, sayin' it's gonna be alright  

'Cause the players gonna play, play, play, play, play  
And the haters gonna hate, hate, hate, hate, hate  
Baby, I'm just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake  
I shake it off, I shake it off  
Heartbreakers gonna break, break, break, break, break  
And the fakers gonna fake, fake, fake, fake, fake  
Baby, I'm just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake  
I shake it off, I shake it off  

I'll never miss a beat, I'm lightning on my feet  
And that's what they don't see mmm mmm, that's what they don't see mmm mmm  
I'm dancing on my own (dancing on my own), I'll make the moves up as I go (moves up as I go)  
And that's what they don't know mmm mmm, that's what they don't know mmm mmm  

But I keep cruising, can't stop, won't stop grooving  
It's like I got this music in my mind saying it's gonna be alright  

'Cause the players gonna play, play, play, play, play  
And the haters gonna hate, hate, hate, hate, hate  
Baby, I'm just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake  
I shake it off, I shake it off  
Heartbreakers gonna break, break, break, break, break  
And the fakers gonna fake, fake, fake, fake, fake  
Baby, I'm just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake  

I shake it off, I shake it off  
I shake it off, I shake it off  
I, I shake it off, I shake it off  
I, I shake it off, I shake it off  
I, I shake it off, I shake it off  
Hey, hey, hey  

Just think while you've been getting down and out about the liars and the dirty, dirty cheats in the world  
You could have been getting down to this sick beat  
My ex-man brought his new girlfriend  
She's like "Oh my God", but I'm just gonna shake it  
And to the fella over there with the hella good hair  
Won't you come on over, baby, we can shake, shake, shake, yeah oh  

'Cause the players gonna play, play, play, play, play  
And the haters gonna hate, hate, hate, hate, hate (haters gonna hate me)  
Baby, I'm just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake  
I shake it off, I shake it off  
Heartbreakers gonna break, break, break, break, break  
And the fakers gonna fake, fake, fake, fake, fake (the fakers baby)  
Baby, I'm just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake  

I shake it off, I shake it off  
I shake it off, I shake it off  
I, I shake it off, I shake it off  
I, I shake it off, I shake it off  
I, I shake it off, I shake it off  
I shake it off, I shake it off  
I, I shake it off, I shake it off  
I, I shake it off, I shake it off  
I, I shake it off, I shake it off
